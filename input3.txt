Beneath the moonlit canopy so wide,
Where shadows dance and dreams abide.
A whispered breeze through trees does glide,
Nature's symphony, a tranquil guide.

Stars above, a shimmering ballet,
Painting stories in the cosmic display.
Night unfolds its velvet sway,
As the universe in silence, does convey.

In twilight's grasp, the colors blend,
A canvas of day bidding farewell, descend.
Hues of gold and amber gently rend,
The tapestry of dusk, a cherished trend.

A river's song, a melody serene,
Reflects the moon, in waters sheen.
Whispers of time in the night convene,
In the soft embrace of the nocturnal scene.

Mysteries linger in the midnight air,
A symphony of silence, beyond compare.
The moonlight weaves a silvery snare,
Capturing wishes suspended in the rare.

Among the constellations, secrets untold,
A celestial ballet, a tale to unfold.
Night's embrace, both young and old,
In the vast expanse, a story is scrolled.

A poet's pen, a gentle quill,
In moonlit verses, time stands still.
A canvas of dreams, a poet's skill,
Capturing moments, both fierce and still.

So let the night unfold its wings,
And in its beauty, the heart sings.
A celestial dance where mystery clings,
In the quiet rhythm, the universe swings.
