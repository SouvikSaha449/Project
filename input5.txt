Starring Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, the film challenges traditional storytelling by presenting a narrative that unfolds in reverse chronological order, creating an immersive and disorienting viewing experience."

[2. Narrative Structure]
Host: "Let's start with the unconventional narrative structure of 'Memento.' The film is divided into two sequences: color scenes moving backward in time and black-and-white scenes moving forward.

Host: "The characters of Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano, and Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, add complexity to the narrative.

Natalie, on the other hand, introduces a new dynamic that challenges Leonard's perceptions."

[7. Themes of Identity and Perception]
Host: "A central theme of 'Memento' is the exploration of identity and perception. The film questions the reliability of memory, illustrating how our understanding of self and reality is shaped by the fragments we remember and the narratives we construct."

[8. Use of Black-and-White Sequences]
Host: "The black-and-white sequences moving forward in time serve as a counterpoint to the reverse chronological order. These sequences offer a different perspective, providing context and filling in gaps in Leonard's memory. The juxtaposition adds depth to the storytelling."

[9. Symbolism: Leonard's Tattoos]
Host: "Leonard's extensive system of tattoos becomes a symbolic representation of his quest for truth and vengeance. Each tattoo serves as a permanent record of information, an externalized memory that Leonard consults to guide his actions."
